Overview

  This project aims to develop a multiple-page viewer website that allows efficient viewing and navigation through documents, particularly those spanning multiple pages. The website will be designed to address the need for a user-friendly, dynamic platform for handling various document  within my organization.

Purpose

  The primary motivation for this project is to streamline the viewing experience of multi-page documents within our workplace. Traditional methods often involve cumbersome software or tools that donâ€™t offer a smooth, user-friendly interface for navigating through lengthy documents. This website intends to simplify this process by providing a platform that allows users to seamlessly browse through multiple pages with ease.

Key Features

- Multi-Page Navigation: Enable smooth navigation through various pages of a document or report.
- Search Functionality: Implement a search feature within documents for quick access to specific content.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the website is compatible with various devices to cater to different user preferences.

Target Users

  This website is designed primarily for internal use within our organization. It will benefit employees working with extensive documents that span multiple pages, streamlining their document viewing experience and ultimately increasing productivity.

How to Use

  The website will be designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Users will search and select the document they wish to view, and the platform will provide a seamless viewing experience. A user manual or guide will be provided to ensure smooth onboarding for all employees.

Future Enhancements

  Future iterations of the website may include additional features such as collaborative annotation, advanced search capabilities, and integration with other productivity tools used within the organization.
